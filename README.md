Tavern Table is a flexible platform for playing tabletop RPGs online. It mimics the classic tabletop experience of using dice and battlemaps, while taking full advantage of the accessibility a digital platform provides.
    
Tavern Table will allow users to engage with customizable 3D battlemaps made from modular pieces. Players and the Game Master will control Tokens, each representing characters or monsters. Every character or monster will be associated with a Character Sheet that stores their statistics. The exact statistics stored will be modifiable via custom Rulesets.
